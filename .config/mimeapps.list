# Linux uses "MIME Types" to determine the type of a file (for example "image/jpeg")
# and the Freedesktop Specifications (XDG) to determine which software should be used
# for which MIME Type.

# The "database" of associations between types and softwares is created by looking at
# mimeapps.list files at several places (global configuration, your specific user
# configuration, ...), and can be edited through the command line using xdg-mime.

# Many softwares (your file explorer for example) will rely on xdg-open to open files,
# which will query your preferences to know which software to start.

# More info: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-utils
